# Prague May Meeting 2024

Welcome to the Prague May Meeting information page. Here is a brief overview of the upcoming meeting. Any information missing? Write to: [tomas.mancal@matfyz.cuni.cz](mailto:mancal@matfyz.cuni.cz).

## Dates and hosting institution: 

**June 10. -- 11. 2024, Charles University, Prague**

## Venue:
Institute of Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, **Ke Karlovu 5, 121 16 Prague 2, Czech Republic**

## Topics of the meeting: 
Hot and not so hot topics in non-linear spectroscopy, primary processes in photosynthesis, open quantum systems, and related fields.

## Meeting format:

The meeting is held in an informal atmosphere, presentations are given in a format preferred by the speaker, spontaneous discussions are encouraged, non-resolved and entirely new scientific topics are preferred. The meeting will not shy away from any topic regarding our scientific community and its interests. An unbinding schedule of the meeting will be available here (soon).

## Travel and accommodation:

Prague can be reached easily by plane, train or bus. From the Václav Havel airport, public buses will bring you to the Metro (Underground) system. Buses and trains arrive in the city center within reach of the Metro system.

Tips on the hotels are easier obtained from online booking services than from the locals, these days. Look for a **hotel in the Prague 2** section of the city of Prague. There are many hotels in the *Sokolská* and *Legerova* streets, in walking distance to the location of the meeting.

The nearest Metro stations to the venue are the **I. P. Pavlova** Metro station and **Vyšehrad** Metro station, both within walking distance.

## Social part of the event:

The whole meeting is one big social event. On Monday June 10th, we will go for a dinner together. We plan a tour through the scientific history of Prague (Brahe, Kepler, Einstein and more). Scientific discussions will be held over coffee and ice cream.

## Number of participants: 

We do not plan to set any strict limits or targets for the number of participants. We expect the meeting to be small and intensive.

## Invitation: 

We are not a club with a membership, friendship is valued more than impact factors. Intellectually relevant contribution to the meeting is what is desired. We welcome suggestions for the list of invitees.

## Summer school: 

After the main event, a two day summer school for PhD students and postdocs in the field will be held. More information can be found on a separate page.
