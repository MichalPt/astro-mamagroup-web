    "courseDescription": "A complete English language introductory course of theoretical non-linear (optical) spectroscopy held at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University as NOOE119: Non-linear Optical Spectroscopy (NOOE119: Nelineární optická spektroskopie). Non-linear optical spectroscopy is a crucial tool for observation of open quantum systems on the natural time-scales of their dynamics. However, the relation between observed spectroscopic signals and the quantum dynamics is highly non-trivial. This course is designed to shed light on this relation, and help students to find answers related not just to non-linear spectroscopy itself, but also to the general topics of open quantum systems, quantum biology and applied quantum mechanics.",
