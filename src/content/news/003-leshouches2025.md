At the end of February, our entire group went to a winter school and a workshop taking place at Ècole de physique Des Houches in French Alps. 

Tomáš and Vláďa were one of the main speakers during the first week, holding several lectures and a very positively received hands-on practical session focused on the quantarhei Python package. Evenings were dedicated to single slide presentations of students. All of us, namely Michal, Veronika, Kačka, Malcolm, and May, had a talk there.

During the second week, Tomáš, Vláďa, and Pavel had talks about their current research, while František and Matteo attended the poster session.
