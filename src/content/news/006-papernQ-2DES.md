Our new paper on systematic choice of excitation intensities in highly nonlinear 2D (and pump--probe) spectroscopy, in collaboration with the groups of Tobias Brixner (Würzburg) and Jacob Krich (Ottawa), is published in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c01177"> J. Phys. Chem. Lett. </a>.
